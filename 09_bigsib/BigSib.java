//HW9 -- Write class BigSib to call it in Greet.java to have the same output as before
//2021-09-30
//DISCOVERIES
//	You can call one class in the file of a different class because Java is a compile language
//  You don't need the main function in a file if the file is not going to be executed
//UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS

public class BigSib{
    public static void greet(String name){
        System.out.println("Why, hello there, " + name + ". How do you do?");
