DISCO:
    - We can't use add() in ArrayList when we want to push() because add will place the input at the end of the list, 
    which may not be the top of the stack, since the pop() method doesn't actually remove the the top value
    - 
QCC:
    - So which one's better?
    - If a LinkedList has both a tail and head pointer, then it probably shouldn't matter whether we add to the front or the end 
    of the list
