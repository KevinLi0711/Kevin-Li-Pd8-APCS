DISCO:

Linkedlist already implements deque according to oracle api, while ArrayList doesn't.
Implementing the deque interface for AL was like writing a wrapper class for ArrayList.
We can do stuff to the beginning and end of the AL easily!

QCC:

How is offerlast and offerfirst even possible for an arraylist because to implement those, we need to get the capacity of the arraylist.
Why does linked list already implement deque?
How is this useful? Does this make working with arraylists more conveninent for us?
