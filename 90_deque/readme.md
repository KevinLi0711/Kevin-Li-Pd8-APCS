We chose ArrayList because we saw LinkedList already implemented deque, so we thought we should use ArrayList for this    
Top priority because these are essential basic functions
* addFirst / addLast (done)
* removeFirst / removeLast (done)
* peekFirst / peekLast (done)
* size (done)

Second priority because these basically do what the above methods do but with a twist
* poll methods (done)
* offer methods (skipped because we can't know ArrayList's capacity)
* getFirst / getLast (done)
