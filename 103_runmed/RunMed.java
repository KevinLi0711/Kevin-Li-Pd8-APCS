DISCO
    - minOf and minChildPos are private because they are only meant to be used within the ALHeap classes
    - minVals is a maxHeap because we want to know the largest of the numbers less than the median
    - maxVals is a minHeap because we want to know the smallest of the numbers greater than the median
QCC
    - the instance variable names make sense but they also make brain go ouchie
    - Why do we keep getting null pointer exceptions when we feed scanner input.nums?
