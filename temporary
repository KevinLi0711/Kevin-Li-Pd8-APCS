Hw22: On producing better code and more quality
2021-10-21

  - Attaching oneself to one's programs is bad because there are objective criteria for a good program, and defects in the program may be a source of personal shame.
  - The comparison of ownership of art to ownership of a program was helpful in explaining why they should be treated differently
  - Cognitive dissonance shows the importance of having a specific mindset in approaching debugging. 
    If you are personally attached to your programs, you will find excuses for when they goes wrong
  - The text makes a really good point about the human eye not seeing what it doesn't want to. I can see why most of our work in this class is done in groups
  - Where does one draw the line between acknowledging human limits and self-deprecation? 
  - Egoless porgramming yileds better organized code because it is expected that others will look over it
  - Managers really don't seem to work well with programmers because they have different mindsets regarding cooperation
  - This class tends to be very open and we usually have to figure things out with little input from teachers. The hindrance presented by management in this text makes 
    me wonder if that same thinking is applied in our class
  - For a field centered around machines, programming is surprisingly very human involved
