DISCO
1. Attempting to execute a subclass file with no main method will instead execute the main method of the superclass (if applicable)
2. setContentPanel is good for changing screens
3. The play method doesn't reset the size of the array, so the reset button doesn't work as given

QCC
1. What the heck is low coupling?

Activity 1 -- Introduction to Celebrity
1. Game Class, Celebrity Class, Info Class
2. number of guesses, points
3. make a guess, check if correct, increment/decrement
4. all
5. Play calls upon guess on one celebrity until the correct answer is reached, play is continued to be called until the timer is up
6. Real World Object: Kevin Xiao
information: Asian, actor, good at math, good at every academic subject, coding hobby, math hobby, writing hobby, loud

Activity 2 -- The Celebrity Class: A Simple Version
1. Constructors create an instance of a class and may assign values to instance variables
2. They don't have a return type in the heading
3. A name and a clue
4. Methods to get and set the name and clue of the celeb.
7. We can create a constructor that takes no inputs and randomly selects a celebrity from an array
    public Celebrity(){
         int rand = (int)(Math.random()*7);
         _name = _celebs[rand];
         _clue = _clues[rand];
    }

Activity 3 -- Putting It All Together
1. JComponent:
Can change borders, can make custom properties, supports drag and drop, can change colors, can change opacity, 
can change layout, can paint borders, can manage keybinds,
can detect mouse movement, mouse clicks, key inputs, changes to components
2. public ArrayList<Celebrity> celebGameList;
because there's no accessor method
3. private Celebrity gameCelebrity;
12. CelebrityGame
13. It knows what instance variables Celebrity has, but it can't access them
